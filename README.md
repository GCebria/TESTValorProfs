Dear team,

Here you can find two directories, one with the API built in PHP Slim and the other one is
the Frontend build on HTML + jQuery (mainly).

There's another file with the database dump that I used.

The API is not hosted anywhere, I developed all in a local server (I apologize for any inconvenience).

Thank you for your time!

I'll wait your feedback.

Gerard Cebriá León.
